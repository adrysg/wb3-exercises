Whispers of Autumn
Golden leaves descend,
whispers of autumn linger,
natureâ€™s soft farewell.

A Glimpse
Stars blink in the dark,
silent wishes chase the light,
dreams take flight tonight.

Unseen Threads
Paths cross in the breeze,
silent threads of fate entwine,
binding hearts unseen.

Ripple
A single stone falls,
ripples dance upon still lakes,
change begins so small.
